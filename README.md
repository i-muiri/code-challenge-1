# CODE CHALLENGE 1

This is a code challenge containing three different projects.

PROJECT 1 -- GRADES
This is a program that prompts a user to input marks between 0-100 and the program outputs the equivalent letter grade as follows A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

PROJECT 2 -- SPEED DETECTOR
This is a program that prompts for a speed input. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points 

PROJECT 3 -- SALARY
This is a program whose task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
